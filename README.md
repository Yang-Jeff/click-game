# click-game

A mouse click accuracy game where the user attempts to click 10 randomly generated targets as fast as possible.

The game runs off a Node.js server with a SQLite database to store high scores.

To run the full app, first ensure you have Node.js and SQLite3 installed on your machine. Clone the repo and
navigate to the folder with the terminal. Then, run "node server" to start the app.

If you want to try the game by itself, visit https://jeffjyang.github.io/click-game/.
