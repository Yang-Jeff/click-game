# click-game

A mouse click accuracy game where the user attempts to click 10 randomly generated targets as fast as possible.

The game runs off a Node.js server with a SQLite database to store high scores.

To run the full app, install Node.js and SQLite3 on your machine. Clone the repo and navigate to the folder
in the terminal. Once there, run "node server" to start the app.
